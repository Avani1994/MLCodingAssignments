NOTE:
1)Plot for Objective function is Plotted using Pylab. After the graph is plotted, kindly close the plot window to see final results of accuracy on test and train sets on commandline. If you don't close the plot window you will not be able to see final results on commandline.

2) My program takes some time (< 10 min.) to run because of larger number of epochs. Kindly be patient.
